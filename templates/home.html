  </br>
    <h3>
      The Great Filter theory is commonly used to explain why humans have been unable to contact extra-terrestrial intelligence.
      The fact that humans have only been able to send radio waves into space fairly recently, indicates to us that another civilization
      in space would have to master such technology before they can contact us.
      It also means that two civilization's would have to be at the same level technologically in the same time period for there
      to be even a possibility of succesful communication. However, It is extremely likely that before such technology is mastered the
      civilization in question destroys itself.
    </br>
    </br>
      Unfortunately, many experts have said that climate change and over-population may be the great filter for humanity.
